<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ocean's 8</h3>
<p>This is my most favorite movie of all time because I love Sandra Bullock, I adore her and I loved all her movies and all her works</p><br/>
<h3>Letters to Juliet</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time as this always reminds me of hope and love.</p><br/>
<h3>Armageddon</h3>
<p>This is my third because I can go back and watch this movie and will still cry at the climax of the story. This posters bravery, hope, trust and love.</p><br/>
